Welcome to Lumache's documentation!
===================================

**PyGlide** (Python Guided Learning through Interactive Digital Education)is a Python library that provides a convenient way to convert Jupyter notebooks into interactive slides. It allows users to create engaging presentations with interactive elements directly from the slides. The library is built on top of the Jupyter ecosystem and uses the Jupyter notebook as the source of truth for the presentation. The slides are rendered as html pages and can be viewed in any browser. The library is designed to be used in a classroom setting, where the teacher can create interactive slides and share them with the students. The students can then interact with the slides and learn the concepts in a fun and engaging way. This project is a proof of concept to create open source decentralized MOOCs.
