Github template 
===============

If you want to use the default settings of PyGlide and automatically host your documentation on Github Pages, you can use this `template(https://github.com/B7M/PyGlide_Actions)`_.

Open the `template(https://github.com/B7M/PyGlide_Actions)`_ page and follow these steps:
#. Click the "Use this template" button located at the top right of the repository page.
#. Give your new repository a name that reflects your project or presentation. You can also provide a brief description if you'd like

#. Click the "Create repository from template" button to generate your new repository.

#. In your newly created repository, click on the "Settings" tab located in the upper right corner. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section. Under the "Source" section, click the dropdown menu and select "Deploy from branch." In the "Branch" dropdown menu, choose "main" and set the folder path to "/root." Click the "Save" button to save your changes.

#. Scroll down to the bottom of the "GitHub Pages" section and check the box that says "Enforce HTTPS." This ensures secure access to your interactive HTML presentations.

Now that your repository is set up!
Push your prepared notebooks to the repository on GitHub. GitHub Pages will automatically generate the interactive HTML presentation for you in the Course_link file. To access it, click on the links. Now, you can share this link with others to allow them to interact with your data-driven presentation.

.. note::
    Make meaningful modification to the README.md file to reflect your project or presentation. You can also add a license to your repository by clicking on the "Add a license" button in the "About" section of the repository.
